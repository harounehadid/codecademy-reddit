Note: There are some slight differences compare to the final product due to feature cuts and other factors

## Features
Here are the list of features included in the application
1. Displaying posts of subreddits
2. Displaying the comments of a post
3. Choosing from a preset of subreddits
4. Filtering what posts to show based on the terms fed to the searchbar
5. Showing loading state
6. The ability to leave an error state (e.g. the ability to refresh the pages if for some reason the application wasn't able to get the data it needs)
7. Add some testing
8. The app can adapt to all screen sizes

## Future work
For the time being the project is in its final form because there is no compelling reason to do so; but if I was going to add more here are a list of things I might've added
* The ability to go the next page on each reddit
* Giving the user the ability to add the subreddits they want to browse
* Having a better user experience
* Having a mixture of posts comming from different subreddits and give the user the ability to control result
